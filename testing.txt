Hello Everyone

.profile commands not executing 
gs must be conflicting with another program because ghost script comes on
Otherwise receive message, bash command not found
Terminal froze had to reload webpage and my hello.rb file disappeared terminal said 
kevinalexanderargueta:~/workspace/git-immersion ((4158d1e...)) $ cat hello.rb
cat: hello.rb: No such file or directory
Recreated file in directory and didn’t know if it affected original on GitHub so pushed changes
This time when I pressed cat hello.rb instead of getting “Hello, World” I was returned the exact lines of code in the file


Still unsure what the checkout command does what it means when you’re in a ‘detached Head’ state or what a new branch is for a repository?
Where is the head, unsure of the concept?
“There’s no undo here, you can’t press a key that reverts changes made by the previous command”

$ git reset HEAD hello.rb
undo's changes we had previously "add"ed to the github from the file (not yet committed)

git checkout hello.rb 
we revert the physical local file to the verison before changes were committed
