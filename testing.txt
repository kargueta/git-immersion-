Hello Everyone

.profile commands not executing 
gs must be conflicting with another program because ghost script comes on
Otherwise receive message, bash command not found
Terminal froze had to reload webpage and my hello.rb file disappeared terminal said 
kevinalexanderargueta:~/workspace/git-immersion ((4158d1e...)) $ cat hello.rb
cat: hello.rb: No such file or directory
Recreated file in directory and didn’t know if it affected original on GitHub so pushed changes
This time when I pressed cat hello.rb instead of getting “Hello, World” I was returned the exact lines of code in the file


Still unsure what the checkout command does what it means when you’re in a ‘detached Head’ state or what a new branch is for a repository?
Where is the head, unsure of the concept?
“There’s no undo here, you can’t press a key that reverts changes made by the previous command”

$ git reset HEAD hello.rb
undo's changes we had previously "add"ed to the github from the file (not yet committed)

<<<<<<< HEAD
$ git checkout hello.rb 
we revert the physical local file to the verison before changes were committed

$ git revert HEAD
brings up this "editor" and you have fine control over the lines of committs made

$ git reset --hard <previous tag>
this resets the head, current version, to the revert to the previous tag

$ git tag -d <tag name>
removes the tag from history

$ git commit --amend -m "name of commit"
If you forgot to include a few changes and already commited some changes this adds those changes
to the previous commit. Equivalent to resetting the branch back one commit and the commitign the new changes

$ git mv hello.rb subdirectory|repository
Moves our file to subdirectory equivalently :
$ mkdir lib
$ mv hello.rb lib
$ git add lib/hello.rb
$ git rm hello.rb

?Why is it that we're asked to add aliases to the config file somewhere before lab 10
and only until lab 22 are we introduced to where the git "stuff" is stored?
=======
git checkout hello.rb 
we revert the physical local file to the verison before changes were committed
